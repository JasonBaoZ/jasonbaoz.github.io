This is a personal website generator! All you have to do is fork this repo, edit `education.json` and `experience.json` and follow the instructions in `SETUP.md` to have your very own personal website that looks just like mine! Everything (including this README is written for someone who has absolutely 0 git or programming experience)

Features coming soon are multiple layouts you can easily toggle through with another `json` file and an executable to help those who have no coding experience create that `json` file!

## Push process after editing
1. In your `github_username.github.io` directory on terminal run the following commands:
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "message here"`
- `git push origin deploy`
2. Then run `npm run deploy`
3. Finally, if you have a custom domain, go to settings in your github repo and change the custom domain on the very bottom to your domain.

## Keeping up to date with master
